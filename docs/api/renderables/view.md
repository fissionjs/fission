# View Documentation

Creates a React component. `fission.view` is a layer on top of `fission.component` that adds a few helpers. This documentation will only go over the differences between `fission.view` and `fission.component`, for any other behavior you should consult the [fission.component](./component.md) documentation.

If you want to make a standalone reusable component, use `fission.component`. If you want to make a higher level page that can be routed to, use `fission.view`. If you don't need info from the router, don't use `fission.view`.
